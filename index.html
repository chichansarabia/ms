        <p>Gaming is good There are many kind of videogames such as role playing games, third person shooter, real time strategy and first person shooters. In all of these genres first person shooters and third person shooters are the most played game genre and it is also the most controversial. They are controversial because they are the most violent and censored games, but nobody stops kids from playing them. Some people say that these games make kids more aggressive and violence. Some people think that these games encourage other to start massacre like Adam Lanza did in Newtown school. Adam Lanza killed many kids from elementary school in Newtown.</p>
